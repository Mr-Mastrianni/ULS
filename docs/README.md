# GitHub Pages

This directory contains a redirect page for GitHub Pages.

The full United Lawn Specialist website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages at:
https://united-lawn-specialist.pages.dev

To deploy the full site to GitHub Pages, you would need to:
1. Build static HTML files for all pages
2. Copy all static assets
3. Configure routing for the single-page application

For now, this page redirects visitors to the production site on Cloudflare Pages.
